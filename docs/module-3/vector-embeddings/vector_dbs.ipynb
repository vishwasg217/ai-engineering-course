    "## What is a Vector Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector database is a specialized database designed to store and retrieve data in the form of vectors. These vectors are numerical representations of objects such as text, images, or products, allowing us to find similar objects based on different similarity measures. In simple terms, instead of exact matches (like traditional databases), vector databases focus on **finding similar things**. For example, if you search for a product, the database returns items similar to it, like products with related features or uses.\n",

    "### How ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbors) and HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) Work\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)\n",
    "When dealing with high-dimensional vectors (like text embeddings or image embeddings), finding exact matches between vectors can be computationally expensive and slow. Instead of searching for **exact** nearest neighbors, ANN focuses on finding **approximately** similar vectors quickly. ANN is a technique where you sacrifice a little bit of accuracy to gain **a lot of speed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications, this trade-off is usually acceptable because most of the time, an approximate match is good enough. For example, when you're searching for similar products or images, the system doesn’t need to find the **perfect** match but just one that’s close enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)\n",
    "\n",
    "HNSW is one of the most popular algorithms used for fast **ANN** searches. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Building a Graph:**\n",
    "   HNSW creates a graph structure where each point (vector) is connected to a few other vectors. These connections are made in such a way that the graph resembles a \"small-world network,\" meaning it’s easy to travel from one point to another in a short number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hierarchy of Layers:**\n",
    "   The graph is divided into several layers. The top layer contains fewer points and connections, while the bottom layer has more. Think of it like a multi-level building. The higher you are in the building, the fewer connections you need to navigate between rooms, and as you go lower, the number of rooms and connections increases. When you search for a vector, you start at the top and move down layer by layer, getting closer to the nearest neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Navigating the Graph:**\n",
    "   When a query vector comes in, HNSW starts by searching in the top layer and moves downward. At each layer, it looks for the most similar vectors based on the distance between them. As it moves through the layers, the search becomes more precise, and it narrows down to the closest vectors in the final layer. The process is fast because it reduces the search space in each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency Gains:**\n",
    "   By organizing the graph in layers and connecting each vector only to a small number of other vectors, HNSW makes the search process **quick and efficient**, even in very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Using Vector Databases\n",
    "There are many options available for vector databases, both commercial and open-source. Throughout the course we will be using [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) as our vector database. Weaviate is an open-source, cloud-native vector database that allows you to store, search, and rank vectors. It pretty much ticks all the boxes for what we need in a vector database. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Weaviate\n",
    "There are mainly many ways to install and use Weaviate. You can use it through Docker, or use their serverless cloud instance, or even through cloud marketplaces like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. But for now we will use Embedded Weaviate which is quite easy to setup and good enough for experimentation purposes.\n",
