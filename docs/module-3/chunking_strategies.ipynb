    "# Chunking Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to chunk the text data into smaller parts before converting them into vector embeddings and storing it in a vector database. It allows us to retrieve the exact content that is relevant to the query, as having irrelevant content in the context leads to unnecessary of tokens and generation of irrelevant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to chunk our text we will be using the langchain text splitters library. This library provides a variety of text splitters that can be used to split the text into smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursive chunking\n",
    "Here, the text is splitted on `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]` characters until the chunk size is small enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "1. `seperators`: List of characters to split the text on. The default is `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]`.\n",
    "2. `chunk_size`: the max size of the chunk.\n",
    "3. `chunk_overlap`: length of the overlapping text between the chunks."

    "We can decide the when the text should split based on a breakpoint set. First we need to set the `breakpoint_threshold_type` to `percentile`, `standard_deviation`, `interquartile` or `gradient`. The we can set the `breakpoint_threshold_amount` to the desired value. If the difference between two sentences is greater than the threshold(`breakpoint_threshold_amount`), then the text is split."

       "['Technology has grown at an unprecedented rate in the 21st century, transforming every facet of human life. From the ways we communicate to how we work, learn, and entertain ourselves, technological advancements have redefined the modern world. This rapid growth, driven by the convergence of the internet, artificial intelligence (AI), and automation, has opened up new possibilities and challenges alike. The early 2000s witnessed the rise of personal computers and the internet, which revolutionized the way people accessed information. Before this period, gathering information meant visiting libraries, reading books, or consulting experts in person. The internet democratized knowledge by making it accessible to anyone with a connection. Search engines, such as Google, became essential tools for finding information instantly.',\n",
       " 'As internet infrastructure improved, mobile technology followed. The introduction of smartphones in the late 2000s and early 2010s, particularly with the release of the iPhone in 2007, marked a turning point. Smartphones brought the internet into everyone’s pocket, allowing for constant connectivity. Apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp further expanded the digital landscape, making social media a central part of modern life. People now had the ability to stay connected with friends and family across the globe, share their experiences, and consume content on the go. One of the most significant advancements of this era has been the growth of cloud computing.',\n",
       " 'Companies no longer needed to invest in expensive hardware to store data. Instead, cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure allowed businesses to store and process data remotely, enabling flexibility and scalability. The shift to the cloud has also supported the rise of AI and machine learning. With access to large datasets stored in the cloud, AI systems can be trained to perform tasks that were once thought to be exclusive to humans, such as recognizing patterns in images or making decisions based on data. Automation is another area that has seen rapid growth.',\n",
       " 'Robotics and AI have been integrated into manufacturing, agriculture, and even healthcare.',\n",
       " 'Factories are increasingly automated, reducing the need for manual labor. In agriculture, drones are being used to monitor crops and automate irrigation systems. Meanwhile, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostic tools help doctors identify diseases more accurately.',\n",
       " 'However, this rapid advancement has not come without challenges.',\n",
       " 'One major concern is the impact on jobs. As machines take over routine tasks, there are fears that many jobs will become obsolete.',\n",
       " 'Workers in industries such as manufacturing and customer service may face significant changes. Governments and organizations are now focusing on reskilling and upskilling workers to adapt to this new reality. Privacy is another growing concern.',\n",
       " 'As people become more connected, personal data is increasingly being shared online. Social media platforms and tech companies collect vast amounts of information on user behavior, leading to concerns about how this data is used. Regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe have been introduced to give people more control over their data, but the debate over privacy is far from settled. Looking ahead, the pace of technological development shows no signs of slowing down.',\n",
       " 'Quantum computing, 5G networks, and advancements in renewable energy technologies are just some of the innovations on the horizon. These technologies have the potential to further transform industries and create new opportunities. In conclusion, the 21st century has been marked by rapid technological advancements that have reshaped society in countless ways. While these advancements have brought about unprecedented opportunities, they also come with significant challenges. As we move forward, balancing innovation with ethical considerations will be key to ensuring a future where technology benefits all of humanity. ']"
