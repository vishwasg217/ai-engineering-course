    "# Chunking Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to chunk the text data into smaller parts before converting them into vector embeddings and storing it in a vector database. It allows us to retrieve the exact content that is relevant to the query, as having irrelevant content in the context leads to unnecessary of tokens and generation of irrelevant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to chunk our text we will be using the langchain text splitters library. This library provides a variety of text splitters that can be used to split the text into smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursive chunking\n",
    "Here, the text is splitted on `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]` characters until the chunk size is small enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "1. `seperators`: List of characters to split the text on. The default is `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \", \"\"]`.\n",
    "2. `chunk_size`: the max size of the chunk.\n",
    "3. `chunk_overlap`: length of the overlapping text between the chunks."
